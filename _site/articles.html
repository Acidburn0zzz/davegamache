        <p>A year and some months ago I launched the first version of davegamache.com on Tumblr. At the time, it was the ideal publishing tool for me and has served me well, but I opted to move to Wordpress for my recent redesign. The original davegamache.com was designed specifically for Tumblr, but this time around I designed with no CMS in mind.</p>

        <p>The concept of craftsmanship fascinates and drives me. There are many definitions of craftsmanship. Some silo the term to physical trades like carpentry, while others pigeonhole it to artistic endeavors. My understanding of craftsmanship is much more fundamental. Craftsmanship is doing what you love and doing it right. No matter what you do — designer, baker, electrician, architect, author — your job is your craft.</p>

        <p>Responsive design is not a silver bullet, but it is the strongest solution to the rapidly growing set of devices web designers and developers have to account for. It would be impossible to design for individual devices and screen sizes these days - instead let's be smart and essentially "bucket" devices into categorical sizes and design appropriately.</p>
