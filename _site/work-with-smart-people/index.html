            <p>The title pretty much says it all. I cannot sing the praises of working with smart people enough. There are so, so many advantages. My team at ZURB is collectively brilliant, but also individually intelligent and talented, and I reap the benefits on a daily basis. Working with smart people means:</p>
<ul><li><strong>You learn more</strong>. Before I started as ZURB I knew only a bit about jQuery and even less about javascript. I was inspired by our engineer Matt to learn more about it...4 plugins and quite a few jQuery-powered sites later, that learning has become invaluable. This is just one example among hundreds.</li>
<li><strong>You get important, critical feedback. </strong>For me, this is true in so many ways, but especially around visual design. Getting input from a team of experienced and talented designers means my ego gets crushed a bit, but my designs and skills only get stronger each time.</li>
<li><strong>Synergy happens. </strong>It sounds cheesy, but it is absolutely true. Working with a team can create results greater than the sum of its parts. What I mean is, three designers could work on a mockup and arrive at three mediocre designs, or they could work together to create a fantastic one.</li>
<li><strong>You keep on top your game.</strong> Working with smart people means pushing yourself to be smarter and to present yourself well everyday. For me, one example of this is making sure I come across with a level of eloquence on client calls. Smart people hold you to a higher standard when you work alongside them and you don't want to disappoint. </li>
</ul><p>Working with people smarter than yourself can be challenging sometimes...or all the time...but it only helps in becoming smarter and more talented yourself. I have certainly seen the benefits of working with smart, experienced and talented folks and would struggle to work without them now.</p>
<p><strong>To all of you awesome co-workers and friends I have worked with or am working with, I tip my hat to you. </strong></p>
