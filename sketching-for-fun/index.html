            <p>I sketch almost everyday at work, but sometimes I like to sketch for fun. Often times it's in the margins and just my variation of a stick figure wearing a crown and a cape, but sometimes I get more into it. Tonight was one of those nights. Here's the initial sketch</p>

<img src="/public/img/articles/catsketch.jpg" alt="cat sketch" title="cat sketch" />

<p>Took a shot of it on my Droid Incredible and then got it into Photoshop. After a couple hours of outlining, masking, blending and texturizing I got something kinda cool :)</p>

<img src="/public/img/articles/catpsd.jpg" alt="cat final psd" title="cat final psd" />

<p>It's funny, often times I like the original sketches more than anything I do to them after in Photoshop and this one isn't an exception. I actually like the more unrefined, organic feel of the plain sketch. I think part of it is that I just like the style more, but part of it is also just that I don't add enough detail to my characters in Photoshop (like the texture I gave his tail in the sketch, which I degraded simply to a color change in Photoshop).Â </p>
<p>When I was a kid I wanted to be a cartoonist. In a way I get to hold on to that a little bit through sketching.</p>
