subtitle:  A Beautiful Boilerplate for Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Development
summary: Responsive design is not a silver bullet, but it is the strongest solution to the rapidly growing set of devices web designers and developers have to account for. It would be impossible to design for individual devices and screen sizes these days - instead let's be smart and essentially "bucket" devices into categorical sizes and design appropriately.

<p>Responsive design is not a silver bullet, but it is the strongest solution to the rapidly growing set of devices web designers and developers have to account for. It would be impossible to design for individual devices and screen sizes these days - instead let's be smart and essentially "bucket" devices into categorical sizes and design appropriately. <a title="Skeleton Boilerplate" href="http://www.getskeleton.com">Skeleton </a>does just this.</p>

<p>About a week ago I pushed the launch button on <a title="Skeleton Boilerplate" href="http://www.getskeleton.com">www.getskeleton.com</a> and just wanted to share a short bit about why I made it and what the experience has been like.</p>

<p class="callout">The elevator pitch for Skeleton is "A Beautiful Boilerplate for Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Development."</p>

<p>My hope is that is becomes the easiest, most awesome way to develop responsive designs that easily scale to mobile sizes (but it is only one solution of hundreds). Skeleton makes responsive design easy by using a grid that starts at 960px, but scales through tablet and mobile sizes through the magic of media queries. In addition, Skeleton rocks a small set of extremely lightweight styles and functions like beautiful typography, buttons, tabs and forms. </p>
