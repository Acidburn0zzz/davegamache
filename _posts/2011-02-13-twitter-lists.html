title: Twitter Lists&#58; Get in Control
subtitle: Using Twitter lists to follow more people
summary: Twitter can be a loud, crazy place if you follow more than 100 people. I recently made a conscious effort to follow more designers from varying backgrounds, interests + focuses, but my problem was my Twitter feed was becoming overwhelming.

<p><strong>Twitter can be a loud, crazy place if you follow more than 100 people</strong>. I recently made a conscious effort to follow more designers from varying backgrounds, interests + focuses, but my problem was my Twitter feed was becoming overwhelming.</p>
<p>I don't handle noise well and often resolve to just tuning everything out, which means I lose a lot of quality content in the clutter.  That's not to say a lot of the people I am following are pushing tweets I don't want to read, but rather that the differences in content make them hard to read side by side. Suppose I just woke up and want to know what crackin' in the design community, I'm forced to also read through tweets from all the other people/businesses I follow. Thus, the brilliance of Twitter lists.</p>
<p class="callout">By organizing the people/companies I follow into digestible lists that aggregate types of content, I'm more comfortable increasing my follow count.</p>
<p>I have been reticent to follow more Twitter peeps since my feed was already becoming somewhat noisy, but allowing me to essentially create filters frees me of concern. I have a number of private lists, but to name a few for example:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Designers: </strong>Members of the design community I think are crushing it (<a title="Desandro" href="http://twitter.com/#!/desandro">Dave Desandro</a>, <a title="Matthew Smith" href="http://twitter.com/#!/squaredeye">Matthew Smith</a>, <a title="Trent Walton Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/#!/TrentWalton">Trent Walton</a>...so many more)</li>
<li><strong>Design Resources: </strong>Accounts that push a lot of tutorial, best of lists and opinion content (Design Follow or SmashingMag)</li>
<li><strong>Friends + Family </strong>(Hear what's going on in my personal circle)</li>
</ul><p>Twitter lists are a necessary feature (for those who follow quite a few peeps), but the next step is going to be a better set of interactions for managing those lists and making them easy to use.</p>
