title: WTF Browser Updates
subtitle: Force upgrades and shorten browser version lifecycles
summary: Google doesn't do everything right, but they're really crushing it with Chrome. There's a lot to praise, but as a web designer/developer I really appreciate their aggressive update strategy. Same goes for Apple and the Safari updates.

<p>Google doesn't do everything right, but they're really crushing it with Chrome. There's a lot to praise, but as a web designer/developer I really appreciate their aggressive update strategy. Same goes for Apple and the Safari updates.</p>

<p class="callout">Browser testing is my least favorite part of development, and I don't think I'm alone. </p>
<p>Now, usually the majority of my headache comes from the IE family, but<strong> Firefox has been starting to get under my skin</strong> with their over-zealous versioning. The list of browsers for both Windows and OSX go on for quite some time:</p>
<ul><li>IE6 (PC)</li>
<li>IE7(PC)</li>
<li>IE8(PC)</li>
<li>Firefox 2 (Mac/PC)</li>
<li>Firefox 3 (Mac/PC)</li>
<li>Firefox 3.5 (Mac/PC)</li>
<li>Firefox 3.6 (Mac/PC)</li>
<li>Firefox 4 Beta (Mac/PC)</li>
<li>Safari (Mac/PC*)</li>
<li>Chrome (Mac/PC)</li>
</ul><p>*Sorta...</p>
<p>The best part of this list are those glorious webkit browsers at the bottom - not only do I love the way they render my CSS and make it easy to jump to mobile since most smart phones are running webkit-mobile these day, but they also only have one version I have to test. </p>
<p>Get on board Microsoft and Mozilla peeps, you're making my life harder with your crazy abundance of versioned software, just update the browser for everyone.</p>
<p>P.S. Don't talk to me about Opera. I know it's great for certain reasons, but I just don't consider it a legit browser yet.</p>
