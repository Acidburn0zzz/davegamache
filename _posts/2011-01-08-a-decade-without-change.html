title: A Decade Without Change
subtitle: Front-end code hasn't really changed in the past 10 years
summary: Alright, so the title may be misleading, but hear me out. I am not saying that nothing has changed in terms of languages (in fact the past few years has held a huge change for front-end languages with the advent of HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery), but the way I write those languages hasn't changed.

<p>Alright, so the title may be misleading, but hear me out. I am <strong>not</strong> saying that nothing has changed in terms of languages (in fact the past few years has held a huge change for front-end languages with the advent of HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery), but the way I write those languages hasn't changed. How do you start your new coding project...</p>
<p><strong>You sit down and start from a blank slate. </strong></p>
<p>Now, this isn't entirely true - especially for me. Being an efficiency freak means I have spent time building what I call a "dev kit" that I work from. It has a solid global CSS that has a few basic styles for UI elements like buttons, forms, nav, etc. Around that CSS is a Rails-inspired directory structure that also has homebrew jQuery plugins with minimal documentation on how to use them, awesome @font-face kits and a number of other assets. </p>
<p>I know I am not the only one who has a skeleton they start from - in fact most efficient designers do. They don't work for <strong><em>every</em></strong> project, but they do for most. </p>
<p class="callout">Imagine being able to take a handful of sketches for an app and building out a sexy, but simple front-end in a few hours!</p>
<p>Why hasn't an awesome version of this "skeleton" been created that serves most designers needs? I think what would be needed to really create a skeleton I would be excited about would be </p>
<ul><li><strong>Comprehensive docs</strong> that would make it easy for any developer to get started with - it would just be plain HTML and CSS, but making sure that the styles and best known practices are documented</li>
<li><strong>One or two awesome base styles</strong> that would be minimal enough to not force a certain visual style, but would still look good stand-alone</li>
<li><strong>Solid and easy to use answers for common UI pieces</strong> like modals, tabtip or image/content sliders</li>
</ul><p>Where is this genius skeleton? I think it may be in the works...somewhere.</p>
