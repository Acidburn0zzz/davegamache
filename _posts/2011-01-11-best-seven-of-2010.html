title: Seven Best Things of Twenty-Ten
subtitle: Parallaxing with jQuery and semantic markup
summary: This past weekend I had some free time between playing Braid and eating, so I decided to dive into a personal one-off site. I was searching for inspiration when I came across Ian Coyle's NikeBetterWorld. It uses a vertical parallax of sorts and I figured I could use a similar technique as a framework to start from.

<p class="callout">Since we just entered a new year I figured why not do a reflection on what <a title="Best of 2010" href="http://www.davegamache.com/sandbox/best-of-2010/">my favorite things of 2010</a> were.</p>
<img src="/public/img/articles/best-of-2010.jpg" alt="best-of-2010" title="best-of-2010" />
<p>Using some very light jQuery and simple markup I cooked up something I think looks pretty awesome. A quick list of what my favorites were:</p>
<ol><li>Graduated college</li>
<li>Got hired by ZURB</li>
<li>Travelled to the Bahamas</li>
<li>Learned to code like a champ</li>
<li>Games + Media (Braid for XBOX, Inception &amp; Mashups)</li>
<li>I started sketching again</li>
<li>The beginning of my adult life</li>

<p>I had a great past year and am really looking forward to 2011. </p>
