subtitle: jQuery is crushing the competition for 3 simple reasons
summary: There are a ton of solid JS libraries these days and jQuery isn't the most mature, robust, well-organized or even feature rich of them, but it is the most popular library and is only getting bigger. Why? I believe jQuery is winning for 3 simple reasons.

<p>There are a ton of solid JS libraries these days and jQuery isn't the most mature, robust, well-organized or even feature rich of them, but it is the most popular library and is only getting bigger. Why? <strong>I believe jQuery is winning for 3 simple reasons:</strong></p>
<ol><li><strong>It provides value immediately. </strong>As soon as you attach jQuery and use your first .slideUp() or .animate() function, you immediately realize its potential</li>
<li><strong>It is dead simple to use. </strong>From a designer's perspective, getting started with jQuery is natural. It allows me to use familiar CSS selectors to grab DOM elements and simple methods like .show() or fadeOut() to make powerful stuff happen</li>
<li><strong>It has killer documentation. </strong>The docs for jQuery are comprehensive, easy to navigate and logically organized. This is huge! Docs make or break getting started with a new "language"</li>
</ol><p>These advantages have made jQuery the dominant JS library and helped me fall in love with it. Learn from jQuery's success and make sure your product or service follows these points. The first two lessons are easy to follow for any product, but awesome documentation isn't always applicable.  At its core, documentation is a learning center, so the equivalent for other products could an awesome tour or FAQ. </p>
<p class="callout">Bottom Line: Create simple-to-use products and services that are immediately valuable to customers and back them with an outstanding way to continue learning.</p>
