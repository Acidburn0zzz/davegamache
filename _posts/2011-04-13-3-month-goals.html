<p><strong>I love to do stuff</strong>. So much stuff in fact, I often find myself overwhelmed by my own unorganized ambition, but luckily, I found my fix. I wrote a while back about my <a title="Brain Drain" href="http://blog.davegamache.com/post/2752745970/the-brain-drain-kills-stress">brain drain technique</a>, which is fantastic for relieving stress and nailing short term tasks, but I was still trying to figure out how to manage longer term goals. While it might not be the perfect fix for everything, I've settled on 3-month goals.</p>
<p><strong>I outline 2-4 objectives in 5 categories, resulting in around 15 objectives for every 3 months. </strong>My 5 categories for the past 6 months have been:</p>
<ul><li>Personal Growth</li>
<li>Career Growth</li>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Travel</li> 
<li>Fitness</li>
</ul><p>I make sure my goals are measurable and attainable. A few examples for the next couple months for me are:</p>
<ul><li>Go on a 2-day backpacking trip with my best friend Parker</li>
<li>Learn how to use AJAX to create stateless micro apps</li>
<li>Payoff 50% of my school loans from senior year</li>
</ul><p>I always work to follow through on these and set dates or milestones for myself, just like I would for a client. Without committing to a date, it's not often you'll realize your goals. </p>
<p><strong>Stop thinking and talking about the things you're "going to do" and write it down.</strong> Make the commitment to yourself concrete and set yourself up for success. I do it with 3-month goals, but it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>Having trouble starting your categories or goals? Take an hour to sit down, think about the near future and answer these questions...What are:</p>
<ul><li>3 things I want to do</li>
<li>3 things I want to be</li>
<li>3 things I want to have</li>
</ul><p>It works for me and I'm sure it can work for you too. <strong>It feels great to have objectives set and feel like I'm working towards goals and dreams. </strong></p>
