title: Custom Data Attributes FTW
subtitle: Make simpler plugins by leveraging HTML5 data attibutes
summary: HTML5 has lots of hotness in the spec, but I feel like the new custom data attribute feature is not getting the love it deserves. For those who aren't familiar with it, the purpose of the feature is to be able to attach data to DOM elements without using something like jQuery.data.

<p>HTML5 has lots of hotness in the spec, but I feel like the new custom data attribute feature is not getting the love it deserves. For those who aren't familiar with it, the purpose of the feature is to be able to attach data to DOM elements without using something like <a title="jQuery Data " href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/">jQuery.data</a>. The syntax is like so:</p>
<p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://snipt.net/embed/b1c2cf58e92a8b3c1e900f76fb6f92d1"></script></p>
<p>Why does this rock so hard? For many reasons, but the one I find personally most valuable is for using with jQuery plugins. I recently wrote a plugin for <a title="ZURB" href="http://www.zurb.com">ZURB</a> called Reveal (<a title="Reveal Post" href="http://blog.davegamache.com/post/2920934181/reveal-jquery-modal-goodness">I posted about</a> it like week) and used the data-attribute to make implementing the plugin for designers dead simple. The majority of jQuery plugins require designers to:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Attach all the JS</strong> (usually just jQuery then the plugin itself)</li>
<li><strong>Create a JS file or inline a script</strong> that calls the plugin within a document.ready (often times this is the challenge for designers)</li>
<li><strong>Change any parameters to the plugin</strong> by passing them to the call to the plugin (if a designer is calling the plugin multiple times with different parameters, it also requires multiple selectors and calls)</li>
</ul><p>For developers, plugins are usually easy as cake, but for a designer not really familiar with javascript (or jQuery) even getting a plugin working can be daunting. After chatting with ZURB's brilliant engineer <a title="Matt Kelly on ZURB" href="http://www.zurb.com/team/matt-kelly">Matt</a> (seriously one of the smartest guys I've ever met) about custom data attributes, I decided to use it with Reveal. The result mean running the plugin requires:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Attach the JS</strong> (jQuery and Reveal)</li>
<li><strong>Put the data-reveal-id on an element</strong> to call a modal (need proper markup on the page)</li>
<li><strong>Parameters are also passed as custom data attributes</strong> (i.e. data-animationspeed="300")</li>
</ul><p>Now, this might seem like a terrible idea for developers who are used to working with large apps or JS-heavy sites. This is true, which is why I also included the usual programatic way of calling the plugin, but for a designer, it makes implementing the plugin infinitely easier in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Here is a simplified code comparison. <strong>This is the implementation of Reveal with programmatic launching:</strong></p>
<p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://snipt.net/embed/3e455c737206159eda6cd2093f73ad98"></script></p>
<p>Confusing eh? <strong>Now check out the code below which is all about the awesome custom attribute implementatoin</strong></p>
<p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://snipt.net/embed/82abded0cdcce668fe28ae0c9290442f"></script></p>
<p>A final quick note is that this is valid with an HTML5 doctype, but will still totally work (but not be valid) on older browsers (even IE).Â </p>
<p><strong>I love the new HTML5 custom data attributes</strong> and am looking forward to using it in future plugins and finding other awesome uses for the feature.</p>
