subtitle: Using Typekit &amp; Tumblr? Here's how to avoid the text flash.
summary: @Font-face is the new hotness and last year was a huge year for non-standard fonts on the web, which has really opened up the possibilities for web designers. Typekit has been no small player in the increased use of @font-face use since it is easy to implement and has some great fonts.

<p>@Font-face is the new hotness and last year was a huge year for non-standard fonts on the web, which has really opened up the possibilities for web designers. Typekit has been no small player in the increased use of @font-face use since it is easy to implement and has some great fonts (like <a title="Proxima Nova on Typekit" href="http://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova">Proxima Nova</a> - the font <del>you are reading now</del> I used to use on my personal site), but I had my reservations about embedding a font through JS. </p>
<p>My concerns were realized when I started using Typekit on this blog and every time the page loaded it initially loaded with my fallback Helvetica, then after a second or so would flash and substitute in Proxima Nova.</p>
<p class="callout">It took a while to resolve, but the issue was putting the Typekit &lt;script&gt; tag in the footer.</p>
<p>Even though putting JS at the bottom of the page is generally considered a best practice, Tumblr users who want to use Typekit need to put the necessary script tags in the &lt;head&gt; of the page. </p>
<p><strong>Just wanted to share :)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>It should be said that there is still sometimes a very quick flash of "fallback" font, but putting the Typekit &lt;script&gt; in the head greatly decreases it.</p>
