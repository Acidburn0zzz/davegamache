summary: My girlfriend Ashley is a full-time photographer for the Harker school, but she's also a fantastic freelancer. The new site is completely focused on her freelance shots organized by category (my personal favorite is boudoir).

<p>My girlfriend Ashley is a full-time photographer for the <a title="Harker School" href="http://www.harker.org/">Harker school</a>, but she's also a fantastic freelancer. I made her a site a while back, but...you know...it wasn't the best ever...but now it is. The new site is completely focused on her freelance shots organized by category (my personal favorite is boudoir). </p>

<p>Check out my design and Ashley's photos at<a title="Ashley Batz Photography" href="http://www.ashleybatz.com"> www.ashleybatz.com</a></p>
<p>I decided I needed to learn how to AJAX some stuff through <a title="jQuery Homepage" href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a>...so each gallery gets brought in without page reloads. It's actually easier than you might think...for the sake of simple server requests jQuery makes the call a piece of cake and handles errors and success callbacks. I love m'lady's photography and I actually really enjoyed making a design was supposed to be unobtrusive and just "<em>got out of the way</em>" of the content. </p>
