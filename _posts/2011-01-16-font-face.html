title: CSS Font-Face Experiment
subtitle: Designing with non-standard fonts for the web is glorious
summary: I have started using CSS3's glorious @font-face capability more and more and decided to take it to the limit, so I started by designing a quick typography poster (making sure to only use legally embeddable font-faces). Below is a snapshot of what is looks like.

<p>I have started using CSS3's glorious @font-face capability more and more and decided to take it to the limit, so I started by designing a quick typography poster (making sure to only use legally embeddable font-faces). Below is a snapshot of what is looks like, but don't take my word for it. <a title="@Font-Face CSS3 Experiment" href="http://onetwentyseven.com/sandbox/font-face-experiment/">Check out the font experiment Â»</a></p>
<img src="/public/img/articles/font-face-experiment.jpg" alt="font-face-experiment" title="font-face-experiment" />
<p>By the end I had included 5 fonts:</p>
<ul><li>BlackJack</li>
<li>League Gothic</li>
<li>GoodDog</li>
<li>ChunkFive</li>
<li>Lobster</li>
</ul><p>Please enjoy <a title="CSS3 @font-face experiment" href="http://onetwentyseven.com/sandbox/font-face-experiment/">the demo</a>. It works best in Chrome, Safari and newer Firefoxes (and basically doesn't work at all in IE...of any kind).</p>
