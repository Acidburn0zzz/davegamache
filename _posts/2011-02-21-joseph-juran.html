title: Joseph Juran
subtitle: 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes
summary: Joseph Juran made the assertion in 1941 that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes and dubbed the principle "Pareto's Principle" (after the early 20th century Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto who observed this law in action in farmland distribution).

<p>Pareto's law was only meant to apply to large systems (big business, economies, society, etc), so it's really not meant to be a lens for individuals, but I think it works just fine. It's one of my favorite "rules of thumb." It is exceedingly simple, but I've found that it works in almost every facet of life:</p>
<ul><li>80% of work comes from 20% of clients</li>
<li>80% of headache comes from 20% of things in your life</li>
<li>80% of revenue comes from 20% of sources</li>
<li>80% of success comes from 20% of your time</li>
</ul><p>The list goes on and on. </p>
<p>The more I thought about it though, Pareto's law is certainly valuable as a designer, but also just as a human :) The four examples I gave above are applicable to a designer, but also to most working people. I find in general, I like to apply the 80/20 rule when I start to get overwhelmed.</p>
<p class="callout">I start by identifying what 20% is causing 80% of my stress, or vice versa, what 20% is causing 80% of my joy. </p>
<p>Once I've worked out those factors, I work hard to minimize my stress and maximize my enjoyment. It sounds overly simple, but it really works well for me. Just give it a try next time you're wigging out with too much to do and I'm sure you will be surprised how effective it is. </p>

<p><strong>Side Note: </strong><a title="Tim Ferriss" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Ferriss">Tim Ferriss</a> writes a decent bit on the 80/20 rule in the <a title="4 Hour Work Week" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4-Hour_Workweek">4-Hour Work Week</a> as it applies to time management from the standpoint of eliminating "time wasters." His strategies are sometimes unrealistic, but <strong>I got to chat with him a bit about it when he came to <a title="ZURB Soapbox" href="http://www.zurb.com/words/soapbox">ZURB Soapbox </a>a few weeks back and he was much more down to earth in person.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Side Note Part Deux: </strong>When I started this post, I was going to write about the 80/20 as it applies to design, but then I discovered there was an article written about a week ago with the same premise (check it out here: <a title="80/20 Rule Applied To Design)" href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2011/02/the-8020-rule-applied-to-web-design/">http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2011/02/the-8020-rule-applied-to-web-design/</a>).</p>
