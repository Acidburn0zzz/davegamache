title: Design Inspiration
subtitle: The web is rich with inspiration, but make sure to organize it
summary: Visual design is my favorite part of the design process, but sometimes it can be challenging to get started. It feels very similar to writing a paper in school - once I get the flow going everything is fine, but writing that first paragraph is always the hardest.

<p>When I'm gearing up to work on a new project there are always a number of aspects I'm excited for, but without fail I always look forward to the visual design phase. Diving into Photoshop let's me take all my sketches and wireframes and give them life. </p>
<p>Visual design is my favorite part of the design process, but sometimes it can be challenging to get started. It feels very similar to writing a paper in school - once I get the flow going everything is fine, but <strong>writing that first paragraph is always the hardest.</strong></p>
<p class="callout">One tool I use to overcome "first paragraph syndrome" is a growing collection of design inspiration.</p>
<img src="/public/img/articles/design-inspiration.jpg" alt="evernote" title="evernote" />
<p>I collect snippets from <a title="Dribbble" href="http://www.dribbble.com">Dribbble</a>, full webpage screenshots from <a title="Web Creme" href="http://www.webcreme.com/">Webcreme</a> and <a title="CSSMania" href="http://www.cssmania.com/">CSSMania</a>, and sometimes even will take quick pictures with my phone. I then put them all into the handy <a title="Evernote" href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>.</p>
<p>I tag all of my entries with suitable descriptors about the style, aesthetic, content or emotion it evokes. For a single design snippet I might tag it "white, minimal, sharp, icons, marketing-homepage." When the time comes for me to start a design and I have an encyclopedia of applicable pieces to inspire me. </p>
<p>I make a point of never basing my designs off another, but I would encourage every designer to build a collection of pieces they admire. </p>
