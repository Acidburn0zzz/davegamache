title: Hosted on Github
subtitle: Why and how I now host all my projects on Github
summary: Last week I popped open an outdated version of Filezilla, looked up FTP credentials for my ancient 1&amp;1 hosting in a Google spreadsheet, then proceeded to overwrite every remote file because I couldn't remember what was up-to-date. Fixing my hosting and deploy process was on my todo list for months, but it consistently took a backseat to sexier projects. I'm happy to announce I finally addressed it and am now 100% hosted on Github.

<p>Last week I popped open an outdated version of Filezilla, looked up FTP credentials for my ancient 1&amp;1 hosting in a Google spreadsheet, then proceeded to overwrite every remote file on my site because I couldn't remember what was up-to-date. Then I cried. Deeply. 

<p>Fixing my hosting and deploy process has been on my todo list for months, but somehow consistently took a backseat to sexier projects. I'm happy to announce I finally addressed it and am now 100% hosted on Github.</p>

<h3 class="art-subhead">Why it's awesome: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>The deploy process is fantastically simple. I just push to a gh-pages branch and it's live in seconds.</li>
  <li>My version control and hosting are the same platform. This makes handling changes a snap.</li>
  <li>Easy deploys mean I'm more likely to address bugs/issues in a timely manner.</li>
  <li>It's free (unless you want private repositories).</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="art-subhead">The limitation:</h3> 
<p>Github pages only serve vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, meaning if your project requires server-side scripting or a traditional database, you're out of luck. That said, greater numbers of projects and libraries are adopting compiled static assets and heavy client-side logic, so hopefully this isn't a crippling contrainst for most.</p>

<h3 class="art-subhead">Get up and running with Github hosting:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a branch off an existing github repo, name it "gh-pages", and push</li>
  <li>Visit <em>yourGithubUsername.github.com/reponame</em> and voila!</li>
  <li>To use a custom domain follow <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages">Github's instructions</a>, but it basically requires placing a CNAME file in the root of the repo that points to a custom URL, then setting the matching domain's A-record to Github's IP address. (204.232.175.78)</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="art-subhead">Deploying in style</h3>

<p>If your site is raw HTML/CSS/JS, deploying is as simple as merging any new changes from a working branch into the gh-pages branch and pushing. You're done. Changes to your site will be reflected almost immediately. </p> 

<p>There are some more complicated situations though. For example, the blog you're reading has Ruby source files that are compiled to create static HTML/CSS<sup>1</sup>. Since Github hosting doesn't support running Ruby, my gh-pages branch must be only the static HTML/CSS. Thus, my master branch is the Ruby source, while the gh-pages branch is only the compiled HTML/CSS.</p>

<p>The challenge then becomes how to merge newer, compiled files from the source branch into the gh-pages branch to be published? The brute force option would be for me to check out 2 instances of the "davegamache.com" repo, one on the master branch and the other on the gh-pages branch. I could work exclusively in the master branch and then drag-and-drop the updated, compiled site into the gh-pages instance when I was ready to publish.</p> 

<p>While the copy-pasta approach absolutely works, I wanted something a bit less kludgy that didn't require me to check out multiple instances of a repo. My solution was to write a bash script<sup>2</sup> that did the work for me. Here's what it does:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Copies the compiled HTML/CSS from master into a temp directory outside the repo</li>
  <li>Switches to the gh-pages branch and replaces old files with new ones</li>
  <li>Does a 'git add -A' to add any new files</li>
  <li>Runs a 'git status' so I know exactly what's changed before I push live</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-bottom: 10px">Here's the alias in full:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3119260.js?file=davegamache_bash_alias"></script>

<p>I have a similar alias for my Skeleton project. I keep source files in the master branch, while the documentation code lives in the gh-pages branch.  Since the docs are built on the source (with some additional custom CSS), I use an alias to keep the docs up-to-date with the true Skeleton source from the master branch.</p>

<h3 class="art-subhead">I love my new workflow</h3>

<p>Using Github as a hosting provider is amazing. If you have projects built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (or that compile to static code), I strongly suggest giving Github pages a chance. Combining version control with hosting seems like a no brainer in retrospect. Since version control already means pushing files to a remote server, why not use that same system to deploy the whole site to a remote server?</p> 

<p class="callout">Faster, simpler, semi-automated deploys means I get to focus on the fun stuff like designing, writing and coding.</p>

<ol class="art-reference">
  <li>My blog is actually built on Jekyll, which is what Github pages is built on. If I didn't have custom Ruby plugins, Github would magically parse my repo.</li>
  <li>Not familiar with your bash alias? It's basically a file that allows you to save terminal commands to shorthand aliases. Read more about it on www.something.com.</li>
