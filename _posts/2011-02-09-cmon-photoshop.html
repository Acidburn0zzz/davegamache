title: C'mon Photoshop, Fix That Radius
subtitle: Why can't I just adjust border radius?
summary: Using Photoshop to create visual designs for sites was not its intended original purpose. The name of the application is "photo" shop, thus it was intended for photo-manipulation, but that hasn't stopped it from becoming the preferred tool of designers. Now that Photoshop is king for web designers, what single feature do I find myself thinking "why hasn't this been addressed yet" almost everyday.

<p><strong>When I create a shape layer, I should be able to change the radius of the corners without having to recreate the shape or manually grab the corner points and make a hodge-podge edit.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, when I scale a shape layer, I should also be able to scale that shape without scaling the corner radiuses (radii?). Given that Photoshop has been through a number of iterations since it has been crowned the de facto web designer tool, I think this should have already been addressed. </p>
