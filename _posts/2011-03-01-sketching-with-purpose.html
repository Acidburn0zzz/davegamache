<p>I wrote a post about <a title="Sketching with Purpose" href="http://www.zurb.com/article/582/sketch-with-a-purpose">Sketching with Purpose</a> over on the <a title="ZURB blog" href="http://www.zurb.com/blog">ZURB blog</a> a week or so ago. We all know sketches are valuable for a number of reasons - they're quick, disposable, easy to do in volume and help visualize problems or solutions. What we don't often think about is how sketches are actually presentations - especially when we are talking about designer/client relationships. Here is an excerpt from the post: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Sketching with purpose means having an agenda for the conversation the sketch will start. Every sketch needs to be a micro-presentation that has a considered intention and direction. A business professional wouldn't come to a meeting to present with a pretty slide deck and no agenda to sell something. The same is true of designers. Sketches should have a clear value and purpose and not just be structural lines on a page.</span></p>

<p>I enjoyed writing it and it helped me formalize some thoughts I had on sketching outside of low-fi wireframes and just sketching UI pieces. </p>
