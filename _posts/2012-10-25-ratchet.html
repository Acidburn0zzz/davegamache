<p>Today, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/connors">@connors</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fat">@fat</a> and I are releasing Ratchet, a collection of vanilla HTML/CSS/JS components for easily prototyping iPhone apps. Its purpose is to help designers and developers quickly turn their app ideas into tangible, interactive prototypes. We believe the best way to test an idea is to build it, then play with it.</p>

<p><strong>Check out the docs at <a href="#">www.dhgamache.github.com/ratchet</a></strong>, or go straight to the <a href="#">source on github</a>. As of today, there are about a dozen components, but it will continue to grow over the coming months.</p>

<p>I'm crazy excited about this launch. Giving back to the community through open-source is something I really believe in. Digging through open-source code has been a primary source of engineering education for me, second only to borrowed time from  incredible friends and co-workers.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think of Ratchet. We built it for you. Hit me up on Twitter <a href="">@dhg</a>, or if you find a bug <a href="">file an issue on Github</a>.</p>
