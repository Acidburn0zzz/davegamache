          <p class="summary">I joined <a href="http://www.medium.com">Medium</a> a few short weeks after it was publicly announced.

          <p class="summary">I was part of <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>'s core product design team working on most platforms: web, iPhone, and Android. The biggest project I undertook at Twitter was a collaboration to redesign every platform with the goal of creating a consistent design system that would work across all devices and could accomodate future features. Following the redesign, I and one other designer architected the HTML/CSS components for Twitter.com and became owners of the front-end for the site.</p>
