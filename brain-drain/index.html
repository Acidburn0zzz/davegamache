            <p>On a day to day basis I often find myself feeling stretched very thin between work, home life, financial responsibilities, personal ambitions and trying to have fun. When there are 100 things running around in my head, the result is that none of them get done and the only thing I end up accomplishing is stressing myself out. </p>
<p class="callout">Thankfully, I found my solution to feeling stressed all the time and I've named it the Brain Drain.</p>
<p>The beauty is it's simplicity. I eventually figured out all my stress was not even necessarily the things I actually had to do, but rather that all of them in my head at once was overwhelming me. How do I deal now?</p>
<p><strong>I make lists...for everything...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Clients duties for work</li>
<li>Blog post ideas</li>
<li>Things I want</li>
<li>Places I'd love to vacation</li>
<li>Stuff I want to read</li>
<li>Incomplete tasks for closing down a site</li>
<li>Groceries</li>
<li>Music I want to get</li>
<li>New years resolutions</li>
</ul><p>...it goes on for quite some time, but here's the beauty: <strong>none of it haunts me anymore.</strong> Because I know I wrote it down I can never lose it. For anything time sensitive, I give it a due date and worry about it when it gets closer. For continuous long term goals, I put them in a list I check a couple times a week to make sure I'm doing what I need to be to get there. </p>
<p class="callout">The brain drain is what keeps me sane.</p>
<p>Use any task list you want: I use <a title="Hit List" href="http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/">Hit List</a> for work-related or design stuff, but I also use <a title="Google Docs" href="http://www.google.com/docs">Google Docs</a> for longer lists or ones that require more exposition around each item. I just started using <a title="TaskPaper" href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper">TaskPaper</a> for Mac thanks to<a title="Mark's Site" href="http://www.markdotto.com/"> my buddy Mark</a>, it's a winner so far. </p>
<p>Use whatever you like, but if you're brain is like mine going 2000mph all the time with ideas, inspiration and things that need to get done...Brain Drain it.</p>
